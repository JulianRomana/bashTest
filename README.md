# BASIC SCRIPT TO PUSH GIT MODIFS
## What does this script ?

Basically it allows you, just with one command, write a commit message and then it will automatically push it to your current branch and will set it as the current upstream branch.

## How to use it

1. Clone the project
2. Put the .sh file wherever you want
3. Give execute permission to your script
4. Go to your .bashrc ( or .zshrc depending on your shell )
5. Create an alias to the .sh file wich will be your command to launch the script ( ex: alias yourcommand="~/your/path/to/the/script.sh" )
6. Enjoy ;)
